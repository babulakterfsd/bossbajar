### About Project 
   - I've developed this site to test and implement ecommerce functionality. The User interface was developed with React and some other tools like hook form, router dom, react bootstrap. For backend, I've implemented Express Server and for storage used MongoDB.


#### Technolgy I've Used: 
- I've used react to develop the UI of this site
- I used font-awesome for icons. And also used react bootstrap for responsiveness and faster design.
- I placed all the data in Mongdb and load from there.
- Context api was used to get data easily from all the route
- Used Private Route, Google SignIn and Email Sign in , Sign Up for Authentication
-I've created my own backend as well as some api's to connect client side to the database
